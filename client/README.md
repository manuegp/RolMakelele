# RolMakelele Client

This is a minimal Angular front-end that connects to the Socket.IO server.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The application provides two basic routes:

1. `/characters` - choose four characters and enter your username.
2. `/rooms` - join or create game rooms after selecting characters.

Angular Material and Bootstrap are used for styling.
